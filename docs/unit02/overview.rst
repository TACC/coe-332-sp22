Unit 2: Working with Common Data Formats
========================================

Please make sure you meet the following prerequisites before continuing past
Unit 1:

1. You can log in to the class server, isp02.tacc.utexas.edu
2. You have a strong working knowledge of `Linux commands <../unit01/linux_essentials.html>`_
3. You have a strong working knowledge of the basic `elements of Python <../unit01/python_refresher.html>`_
4. You have a strong working knowledge of `version control with Git <../unit01/version_control_1.html>`_



In Unit 2, we will begin to explore and work hands-on with essential data
formats that we will use throughout the course. We will primarily be using
Python to interact with and manipulate the data. Sample data sets for
illustration purposes will be downloaded from various sources, including
`NASA's open data site <https://data.nasa.gov/>`_.
