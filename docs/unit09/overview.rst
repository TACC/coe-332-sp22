Unit 9: Continuous Integration, Integration Testing
===================================================

Up to this point, we have worked on all of the different tools, technologies, and
components that will go into the software systems we will build for our final
projects. In this unit, we will further discuss how we will approach building
our software systems between our development environment (ISP02) and the deployment
environment (kube-2). We will also learn some new techniques to help speed up the
development cycle and catch errors as we go - namely continuous integration and
integration testing.
