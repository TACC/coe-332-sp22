Unit 5: Introduction to APIs and Flask
=======================================

In Unit 5, we will be introduced to Application Programming Interfaces 
(APIs). This introduction will form the foundation of our ultimate goal to 
create large, complex, Python-based applications that are accessible through 
the web. The particular Python web framework we will be working with most is 
called Flask.
