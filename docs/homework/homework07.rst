Homework 07
===========

**Due Date: Thursday, Apr 28, by 11:00am CDT**


Million Dollar Diagram
----------------------

This homework is designed to get you a jumpstart on the software diagram for your
final project. There are no coding elements required. The only two things to turn in
in are a software diagram (image file) and a README file.


PART 1
~~~~~~

Create a software diagram showing off some interesting aspect of your Midterm
project. You may choose which part(s) to illustrate and what type of software
diagram you wish to create. See the class materials for
`examples <https://coe-332-sp22.readthedocs.io/en/main/unit08/diagrams.html>`_.

The diagram should be saved as an image file (e.g. png or something that will render
in the README markdown file.


PART 2
~~~~~~

The README should have a detailed description of the design diagram and a 
link to your midterm project that it is referencing. The target audience for 
the description is the same as the target audience for your final project write
ups - your engineering peers who are not taking this class.
