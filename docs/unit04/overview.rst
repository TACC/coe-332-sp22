Unit 4: Containerization and Automation
=======================================

In Unit 4 we begin to isolate our work from our development environment through
a process called *containerization*. We will learn how to use existing containers,
build our own containers, and push containers to a public container registry. We
will also see how to automate some of our more tedious processes in order to speed
up the development cycle.

If you don't have one already, please create an account on
`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/signup>`_,
which we will use extensively in this class. (The username does not have to be
the same as your GitHub username, but it will make things less confusing later
on if the usernames match).
