Unit 1: Onboarding and Essential Skills
=======================================

We will use the first couple weeks of class to set expectations and describe
requirements for the upcoming semester. We will begin to set up some necessary
accounts and onboard students to the TACC / class ecosystem. We will also
quickly review essential Linux, Python, and Version Control (Git) skills that
will be necessary for the rest of this course.
