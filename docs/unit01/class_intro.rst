**Catalog Description:**

Covers methods and tools for planning, designing, implementing, validating and
maintaining large software systems. May include project work to build a software
system as a team, using appropriate software engineering tools and techniques.


**Prerequisites:**

Computational Engineering 322 with a grade of at least C-.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Should Have Before Entering This Course:**

This course assumes familiarity with the Python programming language and strong
working knowledge of basic, high-level language programming concepts including
data structures, conditionals, loops, and functions. We also assume a basic,
working knowledge of the Linux command line. We will briefly review programming
concepts in Linux and Python during the first week of class, the first homework
assignment will be based on these topics, and we will make every effort to help
students who are less familiar with these concepts. Ultimately, each student is
expected to and responsible for mastering this material. This is not an
introductory programming class and we will not have time to give a comprehensive
treatment of all of these topics.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Gain from this Course (Learning Outcomes):**

The objective of this course is to introduce students to advanced computing
concepts in software engineering, software systems design, cloud computing,
distributed systems, and computational engineering. Through a series of
assignments spanning the course of the semester, students will build a
cloud-based, computational system to interact with a time series data set
and provide a web-accessible interface to their system.


**Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes:**

This course contributes to the ABET Criterion 3 student outcomes that took
effect with the Fall 2019 semester.  For more information, see Criteria for
Accrediting Engineering Programs, 2020-2021 at

**Topics (subject to change):**

* Software engineering and design practices in Python (d=30) (outcomes=1,2,3,4,5,6,7; criteria=M,N,O,P)
* Version control with Git (d=1)(outcomes=2,3,5; criteria=N,O,P)
* Unit testing, integration testing, continuous integration (d=4) (outcomes=1,2,6; criteria=M,N,O,P)
* Linux containers with Docker, container orchestration (d=4) (outcomes=1,2,7; criteria=M,N,O,P)
* HTTP and RESTful web services (d=5) (outcomes=1,2,6, criteria=M,N,P)
* Application programming interfaces (d=2) (outcomes=1,2,3; criteria=M,N,O,P)
* Virtualization with Kubernetes (d=4) (outcomes=1,2,7; criteria=M,N,P)
* Databases and Queues (d=4) (outcomes=1,2,6; criteria=M,N,P)
* Asynchronous programming patterns in distributed systems (d=2) (outcomes=1,2,5,6,7; criteria=M,N,P)
* Other advanced topics as time permits

Please note: In the course of learning and working through the above topics,
students will be exposed to data sets from a variety of sources (e.g.
https://data.nasa.gov/browse) representing other select Criterion (A-L) relevant
to the ABET program accreditation. The exact data sets and types of data will
depend on individual student interests.


**Professionalism Topics:**

Throughout the course, students will be taught to communicate professionally in
the documentation of their software and in their software engineering & design
projects. Effective communication in software projects is necessary to inform
other engineers about the purpose or function of the project, and how to use it.
Students will form teams to work together on the Final Projects (see description
below) and will be required to address ethical and professional responsibilities
in the course of working on their project.


**Design Assignments (Final Project Description):**

The Final Project will be a culmination of all materials covered in the class.
Students will build a cloud-based, computational system to interact with a time
series data set and provide a web-accessible interface to their system. Prior to
working on the Final Project, students will form teams to work through a “design”
phase where they must identify a primary data set to work on, describe API
endpoints, diagram architecture components, and draft other major documentation
components. In addition, students will be required to write in their own words
what they think their ethical and professional responsibilities are as an
engineer and how that relates to the Final Project. The project design will be
pitched to the instructors and given feedback / subject to approval. The Final
Project will be due at the end of the semester in the form of a written report
(e.g. pdf) and a GitHub repository containing the software and all support files.
The full Final Project description will be posted on the class webpage.


**Computer:**

The entire course will be computer based. The instructors will provide a remote
server for students to work on. Students are expected to have access to a
personal / lab computer with a web browser and a terminal (or SCP client).


**Text:**

No textbook will be used for this course.


**Class Format:**

The class will be delivered in a hybrid format, utilizing both online and
in-person experiences. Following UT’s guidance, the first two weeks will be
exclusively delivered via Zoom. During those two weeks we will continue to
monitor for updated guidance from UT with the plan to eventually transition to
in person if safe and appropriate. If / when we transition to in person lectures,
we will continue to also offer the lectures via Zoom for those who do not wish
to attend in person. This is subject to change.

Most class meetings will be comprised of lectures/demonstrations and hands-on
labs. Students are expected to attend every lecture and actively participate in
the hands-on labs during the class. The hands-on portions will often solve parts
of homework assignments. Lecture materials with worked examples will be posted
to the class website right before the class meeting. Additionally, there will be
a class Slack channel for discussing ideas about the course with your fellow
students.

* Week 1: Onboarding, Linux, Python Review
* Week 2: Version Control, Working with JSON, CSV, XML
* Week 3: Unit Testing, Logging,
* Week 4: Intro to Containers, YAML

* Week 15: Special Topics - Final Week of Class
* Final Exam Day / Time: Thursday, May 12, 9:00 am-12:00 noon, **Final Project Due**


**Grading:**

Grades for the course will be based on the following:

* 30% Homework – Approximately 8-10 coding / software design assignments to be
  submitted via GitHub.
* 30% Midterm – A midterm design project will include concepts from the first
  half of the semester and build on the first 4-5 homework assignments. A
  written component will also be required.
* 40% Final Project - Students will form groups to work on a final class project
  consisting of a distributed, web-accessible, cloud system to interact with a
  time series data set. The project will draw from and build upon work done
  throughout the semester in homework assignments. The project will need to be
  pitched to the instructors for approval, and a written component will also be
  required.


**Attendance:**

Regular attendance is expected but absences will not count against the student’s
grades. We expect students to give us a week notice in advance of their absence
if known ahead of time.


**Office Hours:**

Office hours will be for 1 hour immediately following the class and/or by
appointment. We plan to use Slack for general communications and to help with
the materials. https://tacc-learn.slack.com/


**Important Dates:**

Please refer to UT’s academic calendar for important dates:

**Evaluation:**

Note that the Measurement and Evaluation Center forms for the Cockrell School of
Engineering will be used during the last week of class to evaluate the course
and the instructor. They will be conducted in an electronic format for Spring
2021. You may also want to note any other methods of evaluation you plan to
employ.

 
**Classroom Safety and COVID-19:**

To help preserve our in person learning environment, the university recommends
the following.

* Adhere to university mask guidance.
* Vaccinations are widely available, free and not billed to health insurance. The vaccine will help protect against the transmission of the virus to others and reduce serious symptoms in those who are vaccinated.
* Proactive Community Testing remains an important part of the university’s efforts to protect our community. Tests are fast and free.
* Visit https://protect.utexas.edu/ for more information.


**Class Recordings:**

Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational
purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared
outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could
lead to Student Misconduct proceedings. Guidance on public access to class
recordings can be found here.
