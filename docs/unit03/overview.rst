Unit 3: Best Practices in Python
================================

In Unit 3, we will work on improving our Python3 code-writing habits to make our
code easier to read, easier to debug, and easier to test. A little extra effort
towards writing good code now will pay off down the line when it comes to
developing and testing new features or re-using old code blocks in new applications.
Specifically, we will learn and practice topics in code organization, documentation,
logging, and unit testing.
