Unit 6: Intro to Databases and Persistence, Containerizing Redis
================================================================

In this unit, we will begin implementing a database using Redis
to hold our data sets such that they persist beyond the lifetime of our application containers.
We will also figure out how to query our data in Python by connecting our Flask
API to our Redis database, and containerize both of our services.
